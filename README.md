# RasberryPiControlGpio

Set a GPIO high/low - turn on/off - from the command line in Python

This will be a test of the Rasberry Pi and Github

I copied the code from https://elementztechblog.wordpress.com/2014/09/09/controlling-relay-boards-using-raspberrypi/ 

Is RPi.GPIO a standard libary or do I need to include it somehow
